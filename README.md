Web APIs are useful for understanding what kind of information is being used during a user's client session. Javascript is also a useful tool to help use that information and turn it into functions in compliance with a user's input/decisions. The task here is to create a quiz with questions pertaining to coding.

## Getting started
Here we have everything we need. Our IDE! Visual code studio provides us to use every technology necessary to have our initial structure in place. It requires an HTML, CSS, and Java file all to be associated through the HTMl. No installation of any other software necessary.
## Built With 
* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript
## Code Snip 
```
function resetUsers(){
    
    var r = prompt(" All users will be deleted. Are you sure want to continue? type 'y' or 'n'", "n")
    if (r === "y"){
        localStorage.setItem("allusers", "");
    }

}
```
* Here using the reset button we are prompted with a confirmation message and a reset local storage option.
